abstract: "Parking policies have significant environmental and economic implications, including effects on climate change, air pollution, energy consumption, traffic congestion, housing affordability and economic development. Parking – on-street and off-street – is also responsible for the consumption of vast amounts of land, and it accounts for a substantial share of the social costs of car ownership and use.

This paper provides insights on how the price and availability of parking influence mode choices and urban form and, how parking reforms may achieve important policy goals. It discusses how minimum off-street parking requirements, employer-provided parking and parking cash-outs affect land consumption and car ownership and use. Most of the evidence it provides is based on the cases of Los Angeles (LA) County and the City of Los Angeles, California in the United States, though a few examples from other cities in the United States and elsewhere are also included."
