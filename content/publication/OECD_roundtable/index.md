abstract: "Parking policies have significant environmental and economic implications, including effects on climate change, air pollution, energy consumption, traffic congestion, housing affordability and economic development. Parking – on-street and off-street – is also responsible for the consumption of vast amounts of land, and it accounts for a substantial share of the social costs of car ownership and use.


Like food and housing, parking is necessary. Most car users expect to find free parking at home, at work and at various destinations such as stores, churches, restaurants, schools and parks. A possible explanation is that parking is typically not supplied as a response to the market, but required by mandate. It tends to be bundled with most land uses, covering large areas with asphalt and parking structures. In addition, the infrastructure required for parking is expensive. Providing for it drives up construction and rental prices and often forces developers to build in more distant, cheaper locations with poor access to amenities such as public transport, in essence shifting parking costs into higher product prices and lower wages.

Parking subsidies also encourage private car use because they collectivise the cost of parking. In the absence of such subsidies, and disregarding the external costs of parking, the individualised parking cost that drivers would incur would be very high, particularly in urban cores. Yet, employer-paid parking, on-street parking subsidies, and free parking at shopping malls partially shield automobile users from a substantial share of the private cost of car use. As a result, parking is free or heavily subsidised because everything else is more expensive.


Availability of parking spaces affects commuters’ mode choice. All car trips start and end in a parking space. When parking is scarce or hard to find at either or both ends of a trip, the relative advantage of public transport exceeds that of car use. However, people will often drive walkable or bikeable distances if parking is easily available. Therefore, policies that contribute to an abundant parking supply, especially in areas well served by public transport, work at cross-purposes with the goals of reducing solo driving and increasing the use of sustainable travel modes.


Despite current expectations in many cities, parking does not need to be free. To achieve a shift from private cars to more sustainable methods of transport it is important to understand the many ways that the price and availability of parking at both ends of a trip influence automobile use, land use and urban form. This will allow for the development of appropriate land-use planning, parking reforms and infrastructure provision and increase the use of sustainable transport modes, such as walking, biking or public transport, to services and places of employment.


This paper provides insights on how the price and availability of parking influence mode choices and urban form and, how parking reforms may achieve important policy goals. It discusses how minimum off-street parking requirements, employer-provided parking and parking cash-outs affect land consumption and car ownership and use. Most of the evidence it provides is based on the cases of Los Angeles (LA) County and the City of Los Angeles, California in the United States, though a few examples from other cities in the United States and elsewhere are also included.


The next section starts by providing estimates of construction and land costs for different types of parking spaces in different locations of LA County. This is important as planners cannot know how much parking mandates increase the cost of development and its other cost implications if they do not know the cost of required parking spaces. In fact, most parking costs are borne indirectly, through mortgages and rents (for most off-street parking provided as part of building developments), or general taxes (for on-street parking"
