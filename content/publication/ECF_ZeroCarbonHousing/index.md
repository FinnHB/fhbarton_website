abstract: "By rolling out a wave of climate-friendly renovations and heat pumps in homes, Europe can save the equivalent of a quarter of current Russian gas imports by 2030, significantly reducing its dependence on volatile gas imports and enhancing its energy security. As a result, the annual spending on gas imports is projected to go down by €15 billion within a decade and by €43 billion in 2050.


Upgrading homes could also deliver important social and economic benefits, as Europe recovers from the Covid-19 crisis and households are strained by high gas prices. A shift to energy-efficient and electrified homes would create many thousands of new jobs, boost Europe’s GDP, slash consumers’ energy bills and increase the disposable income of the poorest households.  


There is a clear relationship between the deployment of heat pumps and socio-economic benefits in the scenarios; the larger the uptake of heat pumps, the greater the socio-economic benefits. The transition to energy-efficient and electrified buildings is projected to deliver greater benefits than a shift to green hydrogen for heating."

summary: "With 40% of Europe's energy being used by buildings, translating to 36% of all CO2 emissions, decarbonising the the building stock is non-negotiable for reach net-zero. The project analyses how Europe may look like under different net-zero transition pathways in the heating sector. Exploring scenarios from hydrogen boilers to heat pumps, analysing the socio-economic implications of the different pathways. "
