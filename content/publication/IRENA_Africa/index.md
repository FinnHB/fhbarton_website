summary: "In conjunction with this project, IRENA contracted Cambridge Econometrics to expand their macroeconometric model, E3ME, to be able to provide more granular economic modelling for Africa. Together with other members of the modelling team, I spent several months processing, verifying, and collating the data for 12 new African Regions plus the United Arab Emirates to be added to the model. Based on the extended version of E3ME, several colleagues (mentioned in the acknowledgements of the report) contributed to the economic modelling which the this report is based on."
